This is a card animation, where when clicked one of the cards, you expand the card desired to full size.
Its like going through photo book or files.
Remember on the CSS to add the background images you desire for each card, there are four cards.
Enjoy 
This challenge is a replica from a youtube video I watched someone doing it long time ago!
